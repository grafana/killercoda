# Get started with {{% param “PRODUCT_NAME” %}}

This tutorial shows you how to configure Alloy to collect logs from your local machine, filter non-essential log lines, and send them to Loki, running in a local Grafana stack.

This process will enable you to query and visualize the logs sent to Loki using the Grafana dashboard.

To follow this tutorial, you must have a basic understanding of Alloy and telemetry collection in general.
You should also be familiar with Prometheus and PromQL, Loki and LogQL, and basic Grafana navigation.
You don’t need to know about the {{< param “PRODUCT_NAME” >}} [configuration syntax](https://grafana.com/../../concepts/configuration-syntax/) concepts.
