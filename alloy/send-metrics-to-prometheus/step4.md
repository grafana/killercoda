# Log into Grafana and explore metrics in Prometheus

Open [http://localhost:3000/explore]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_3000}}/explore) to access the **Explore** feature in Grafana.

Select Prometheus as the data source and click the **Metrics Browser** button to select the metric, labels, and values for your labels.

Here you can see that metrics are flowing through to Prometheus as expected, and the end-to-end configuration was successful.
