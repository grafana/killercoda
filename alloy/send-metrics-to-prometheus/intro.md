# Use Grafana Alloy to send metrics to Prometheus

In the [previous tutorial](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/tutorials/send-logs-to-loki/), you learned how to configure Alloy to collect and process logs from your local machine and send them to Loki.

This tutorial shows you how to configure Alloy to collect and process metrics from your local machine, send them to Prometheus, and use Grafana to explore the results.

> Since this tutorial builds on the previous one, a setup script is automatically run to ensure you have the necessary prerequisites in place. This should take no longer than 1 minute to complete. You may begin the tutorial when you see this message: `Installation script has now been completed. You may now begin the tutorial.`
