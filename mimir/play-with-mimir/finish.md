# Summary

In this tutorial you started Grafana Mimir locally in a high-available setup as well as a Prometheus instance that remote wrote
some metrics to Grafana Mimir. You then queried those metrics stored in Mimir using Grafana, and visualized them in some Grafana dashboards.
Lastly, you configured a recording rule and an alert via the Grafana Alerting UI and verified that the alert fired as expected when the condition was met.
