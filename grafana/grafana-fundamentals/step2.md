This demo does not require a login page or credentials. However, if you choose to install Grafana locally, you will need to log in and provide credentials. In that case, the default username and password is `admin`{{copy}}.

The first thing you see is the Home dashboard, which helps you get started.

In the top left corner, you can see the menu icon. Clicking it will open the _sidebar_, the main menu for navigating Grafana.
