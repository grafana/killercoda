# Quick start for Tempo

The Tempo repository provides [multiple examples](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/tree/main/example/docker-compose) to help you quickly get started using Tempo and distributed tracing data.

Every example has a `docker-compose.yaml`{{copy}} manifest that includes all of the options needed to explore trace data in Grafana, including resource configuration and trace data generation.

The Tempo examples running with Docker using docker-compose include a version of Tempo and a storage configuration suitable for testing or development.

> **Tip:**
> A setup script is running in the background to install the necessary dependencies. This should take no longer than 30 seconds. Your instance will be ready to use once you `Setup complete. You may now begin the tutorial`{{copy}}.
