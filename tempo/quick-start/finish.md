# Next steps

You have successfully set up Tempo and Grafana to explore traces generated by the k6-tracing service.

## Alternative: Complete MLTP example

If you would like to use a demo with multiple telemetry signals, then try the [Introduction to Metrics, Logs, Traces, and Profiling in Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/intro-to-mlt).
`Intro-to-mltp`{{copy}} provides a self-contained environment for learning about Mimir, Loki, Tempo, Pyroscope, and Grafana.
The project includes detailed explanations of each component and annotated configurations for a single-instance deployment.
Data from `intro-to-mltp`{{copy}} can also be pushed to Grafana Cloud.
