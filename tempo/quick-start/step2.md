# Explore the traces in Grafana

As part of the docker compose manifest, Grafana is now accessible on port 3000. We can use Grafana to explore the traces generated by the k6-tracing service.

1. Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_3000}}).

1. Once logged in, navigate to the **Explore** page, select the **Tempo** data source and select the **Search** tab. Select **Run query** to list the recent traces stored in Tempo. Select one to view the trace diagram:

1. A couple of minutes after Tempo has started up successfully, select the **Service graph** tab for the Tempo data source in the **Explore** page. Select **Run query** to view a service graph, generated by Tempoâ€™s metrics-generator.

   ```
   docker compose down -v
   ```{{copy}}
