# Tutorial Completed: Introduction to Metrics, Logs, Traces and Profiles in Grafana

Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial on Metrics, Logs, Traces, and Profiles in Grafana. You have learned how to use Grafana to monitor and analyze various aspects of your application's performance.

## What's Next?

Now that you have completed this tutorial, you can explore more advanced topics in Grafana or dive deeper into specific areas of interest. Here are a few suggestions:

- Explore other Grafana tutorials and documentation to expand your knowledge.
- Experiment with different data sources and visualizations in Grafana to gain a deeper understanding of your application's metrics, logs, traces, and profiles.
- Join the Grafana community and participate in discussions, ask questions, and share your experiences with others.

### Deployment

You can swap out the local Observability Stack and instead use Grafana Cloud.

Read the [Using Grafana Cloud Hosted Observability](https://github.com/grafana/intro-to-mltp/blob/main/README.md#Grafana-Cloud) section below to use this environment instead.

### OpenTelemetry Collector (Optional)

You can swap out the Grafana Alloy for the OpenTelemetry collector using an alternative configuration.

Read the [Using the OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/grafana/intro-to-mltp/blob/main/README.md#Using-the-OpenTelemetry-Collector) section below to use this environment instead.
