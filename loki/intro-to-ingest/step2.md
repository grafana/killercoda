# Step 2: Investigating the logs

In the previous step, we generated logs using the Carnivorous Greenhouse application. In this step, we will investigate the logs that were generated. These logs where tailed by Alloy and sent to Loki. Let's explore the logs.

## Explore the logs

To start exploring the logs, we will use the Grafana Explore Logs view. This is a new queriless way to explore logs in Grafana.

1. To access this view, follow this link: **[http://localhost:3000/a/grafana-lokiexplore-app/explore]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_3000}}/a/grafana-lokiexplore-app/explore)** 

2. From there experiment with the different options available to you. Drill down into the logs and see what you can find.


### Open In Explore

You all also have the option to open your current log view in Explore. This will allow you to continue your investigation in the Explore view. To do this, click the **Open in Explore** button.
