# Step 3: Running our stack

We are now ready to run our stack. We will start the OpenTelemetry Collector, Loki, and Grafana.

## Starting the observability stack

To start the observability stack, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```{{execute}}

## Run our Python application

Next, we will run our Python application. We will use the following command to run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```{{execute}}

## Accessing the Carnivorous Greenhouse application

The Carnivorous Greenhouse application is now running. You can access the application by clicking on the following link:
[http://localhost:5005]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_5005}})

Create an account, login, and collect metrics from a series of hungry plants. All of these actions generate logs that are sent to Loki. The application can also be toggled to generate errors.

## Accessing logs in Grafana

The logs generated by the Carnivorous Greenhouse application are sent to Loki. You can access the logs in Grafana by clicking on the following link:

[http://localhost:3000/explore]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_3000}}/explore)
