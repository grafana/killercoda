## Sandbox Overview

This online sandbox is part of the “Introduction to ingesting logs into Loki using Fluentd and Fluent Bit” video. In this sandbox, you will learn how to ingest logs into Loki using Fluentd and Fluent Bit. The sandbox environment consists of the following components:

- **Loki**: Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost-effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.

- **Fluentd**: Fluentd is an open-source data collector for unified logging layer. It allows you to unify data collection and consumption for better use and understanding of data.

- **Fluent Bit**: Fluent Bit is a fast and lightweight log processor and forwarder for Linux, OSX, and BSD family operating systems. It has been designed to be the perfect companion for cloud-native environments.

- **Carnivorous Greenhouse**: Carnivorous Greenhouse is a simple application that generates logs. This allows users to create an account, login and collect metrics from a series of hungry plants. All of these actions generate logs that are sent to Loki. The application can also be toggled to generate errors.

- **Grafana**: Ofcourse the architecture would not be complete without Grafana. Grafana will be used to visualize the logs generated by the Carnivorous Greenhouse application. We will be making use of a new feature in Grafana 11 called Explore Logs.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues with the environment, please report them to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/grafana/killercoda)
