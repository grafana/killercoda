# Quickstart to run Loki locally

If you want to experiment with Loki, you can run Loki locally using the Docker Compose file that ships with Loki. It runs Loki in a [monolithic deployment](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/deployment-modes/#monolithic-mode) mode and includes a sample application to generate logs.

The Docker Compose configuration instantiates the following components, each in its own container:

- **flog** a sample application which generates log lines.
  [flog](https://github.com/mingrammer/flog) is a log generator for common log formats.

- **Grafana Alloy** which scrapes the log lines from flog, and pushes them to Loki through the gateway.

- **Gateway** (nginx) which receives requests and redirects them to the appropriate container based on the requestâ€™s URL.

- One Loki **read** component (Query Frontend, Querier).

- One Loki **write** component (Distributor, Ingester).

- One Loki **backend** component (Index Gateway, Compactor, Ruler, Bloom Compactor (Experimental), Bloom Gateway (Experimental)).

- **Minio** an S3-compatible object store which Loki uses to store its index and chunks.

- **Grafana** which provides visualization of the log lines captured within Loki.
