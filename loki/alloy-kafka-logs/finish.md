# Complete metrics, logs, traces, and profiling example

If you would like to use a demo that includes Mimir, Loki, Tempo, and Grafana, you can use [Introduction to Metrics, Logs, Traces, and Profiling in Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/intro-to-mlt). `Intro-to-mltp`{{copy}} provides a self-contained environment for learning about Mimir, Loki, Tempo, and Grafana.

The project includes detailed explanations of each component and annotated configurations for a single-instance deployment. Data from `intro-to-mltp`{{copy}} can also be pushed to Grafana Cloud.
