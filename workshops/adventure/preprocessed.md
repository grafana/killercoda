- **Interact with Characters**: Talking to NPCs like the blacksmith, wizard, or priest can open new paths.

- **Beware of Choices**: Some decisions, like accepting the wizard's offer, have consequences.

### Sample Gameplay Flow

1. **Starting Out**:
   - You're at the starting point with the option to `go north` or `cheat`.
   - Typing `go north` takes you to the forest.

2. **In the Forest**:
   - Options include `go north` to the cave, `go south` back to start, `go to town`, or `pick herb`.
   - You might choose to `pick herb` and then `go to town`.

3. **In the Town**:
   - Several locations to explore: `blacksmith`, `mysterious man`, `quest giver`, `chapel`.
   - Visit the `blacksmith` to `request sword`.

4. **At the Blacksmith**:
   - After requesting a sword, you'll need to `heat forge` and `check sword` periodically.
   - Adjust the forge heat using `heat forge` and `cool forge` until the sword is ready.

5. **Getting the Sword**:
   - Once the forge is at the correct temperature, `check sword` will let you obtain it.
   - With the sword, you can interact with other characters differently.

6. **Meeting the Wizard**:

   - Decide whether to `accept his offer` or `decline his offer`.

   - Your ability to complete the quest may depend on previous choices.
